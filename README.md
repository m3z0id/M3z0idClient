# M3z0id Client
This is a command utility to confuse people when counting on Discord. ([counting#5250](https://countingbot.com/) bot)
## Installation
There's an executable for Windows only, **which is not guaranteed to be up to date**.
So compiling from source is better.
## Usage
M3z0id Client currently has 6 modes - `1`, `69`, `random`, `subtract`, `set`, `add` and `factorial`.
### Modes `1`, `69`, `random`, `subtract` and `set`.
The usage is: `M3z0idClient [--random-zeroes] <number> [1/69/random/subtract/add/factorial]`
Note that the flag `--random-zeroes` doesn't work with `factorial` mode.
### Mode `set`
The usage is: `M3z0idClient [--random-zeroes] <number> set <number1>, <number2>, <number3>, ...`
If the amount of set numbers is bigger than the number to convert, not all numbers will be used. Only the numbers defined first will be used.
