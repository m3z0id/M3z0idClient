# M3z0id Client
This is a command utility to confuse people when counting on Discord. ([counting#5250](https://countingbot.com/) bot)
## Installation
There's an executable for Windows only, **which is not guaranteed to be up to date**.
So compiling from source is better.
## Usage
M3z0id Client currently has 6 modes - `1`, `69`, `random`, `subtract`, `add` and `factorial`.
The usage is: `M3z0idClient [-n | --number] <number> [-m | --mode] <1/69/random/subtract/add/factorial> (--random-zeroes)`
Note that the flag `--random-zeroes` doesn't work with `factorial` mode.
